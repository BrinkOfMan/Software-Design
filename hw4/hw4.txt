            width: 80%
            height: 80%

Exercise 2: What character is at index [15]?
- t

Exercise 3: Modify the yaml for the message bubble to show the time and the author below the text message, with the time to the left of the author

- View:
    style:
      backgroundColor: aqua
      width: 200
      borderRadius: 15

          style:
            color: black
            fontSize: 20
            marginLeft: 10
      - Text: # author
          index: 10
          style:
            color: green
            fontSize: 15
            marginLeft: 60
      - Text:  #time
          index: 1
          style:
            color: gray
            fontSize: 10
            position: absolute
            left: 10
            top: 66%

What would happen in the above code if the second guard were changed from n % 3 == 1 to n % 3 > 0?
- This would always be the else case that would run (assuming the user inputs an integer), as it would catch remainders of both 1 and 2.
- Even if n%3 == 2, it would say "This integer has a remainder of one, when divided by three.\n"

Exercise 5: What will the following loop do?
- This will print:
**

Exercise 6: What will the following loop do?
- This will print:
loading...
loading... 
loading... 
loading... 
loading...

Exercise 7: What does the following loop do?
- This will print:
loading... 
loading... 
loading... 
loading... 

Exercise 9:  Why do you think we moved the line that writes "Blastoff!!!" inside of the for loop? What does the if statement around that line need?
- Had it been outside of the for loop, it would have printed regardless if there was a break or a completion of the loop.
- It needs an "else" in front of the "if", as the computer will check both if statements even if the first one is calculated to be true.

Exercise 10: We left the “Blastoff!!!” line in the same place in this example.  Was that necessary? 
- I don't believe so. There isn't a reason to guard it from a loop break, so I assume the programmer assumes the while loop will execute fully.
- Plus, removing it from the loop removes an unnecessary if statement.

Exercise 11: Write a for loop that iterates by -5 from 100 to 0
- OK
#include"../print.h"
int main() {
  for (int i = 100; i >=0; i-=5) {
      print_int(i);
      print("\n");
  }
}

Exercise 12:  Start by setting an int variable n to 1.  Then use a while loop to double n until n is greater than 100.  Do not use a break statement.
- OK
#include"../print.h"
int main() {
  int n = 1;
  print("Starting at 1. Time to double.\n");
  while(n <= 100){
      n*=2;
      print_int(n);
      print("\n");
  }
}

Exercise 13:  Write a loop that will make the iterator i be the even numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive).  Set a variable n to be i2, except when i is evenly divisible by 5 (use a continue).
-A bit specific, but OK
#include"../print.h"
int main() {
  int n;
  for(int i = 0; i <= 100; i+=2){
      if (i % 5 == 0)
        continue;
      print("i: ");
      print_int(i);
      n = i*i;
      print(", n: ");
      print_int(n);
      print("\n");
  }
}

Exercise 14:  Write a loop that successively sets a variable n to be the first 10 Fibonacci numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55).
- OK
#include"../print.h"
int main() {
    int prv = 0, n = 1, pre;
    for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++){
      pre = prv + n;
      print_int(n);
      print("\n");
      prv = n;
      n = pre;
  }
}

Exercise 15:  Copy the two bytes giving the temperature to the beginning of the area of memory that you see displayed.
- OK
#include"../show_mem.h"

int main() {
  init();

  fetch("https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MPX/111,47/forecast", -2000);
  char &c1 = char_at(0);
  c1 = char_at(271);
  char &c2 = char_at(1);
  c2 = char_at(272);

  quit();
}

Exercise 16:  Copy all the bytes for the detailedForecast to the beginning of the area of memory that you see displayed.  Hint:  use a loop!
- Quite the brainteaser
#include"../show_mem.h"

int main() {
  init();

  fetch("https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/MPX/111,47/forecast", -2000);
  
  int posOriginal;
  int posNew;

  for (posOriginal = 0; posOriginal <= 15; posOriginal++){
    //goes through all the characters in "detailedForecast"
    posNew = posOriginal + 576;             //new character is 576 places away from the original (index 576 is "d" and 591 is "t")
    char &cOriginal = char_at(posOriginal); //assign a character to a new place in memory
    cOriginal = char_at(posNew);            //replace what that character is with the character 576 places away
  }

  quit();
}
