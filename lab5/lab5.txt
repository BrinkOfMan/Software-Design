Exercise 4: Describe in your own words what this program does, from the user point of view.  Then describe (in your own words) how the boolean variable first_time is used to make the behavior what it is.
- This program asks me my name, and then respnds with my name when I type it in.
- Anything else I type, it responds by saying OK, <whatever I typed>
- The boolean first_time is set to true before the first iteration of the while loop, which passes the conditional that prompts the user to imput their name.
- After this, first_time is set to false, and every future iteration of the while loop will pass into the "OK, <input>" conditional
