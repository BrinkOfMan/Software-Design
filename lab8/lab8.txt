Exercise 1: It is conventional to call the two arguments argc and argv;  why do you think these names were chosen?  Why did the program above use (argc-1) in the second output statement?
- argc would probably mean argument count and argv would probably mean argument values
- maybe the call to execute this program is iteself an argument, meaning if we were to call it with no other arguments it would say that 1 argument was used?

Exercise 13: Looks like it works
output:
0
Ethan> hello there
2
Ethan> test 1
3
Ethan> test 2
4
Ethan> test 3
5
Ethan> Abby typed hello before I typed hello there, and world after I typed test 3
7
Ethan>
