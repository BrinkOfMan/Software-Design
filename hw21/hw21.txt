Exercise 3:   Verify that, given such a pure virtual function, we cannot create a plain Food object, nor can we create a Nachos object if we comment out the print_order() function in the Nachos class.
- Whoops, I created my own class to make it easier to understand for myself. Hope that's not an issue
- pure_virtual.cpp:47:10: error: cannot declare variable ‘base’ to be of abstract type ‘Base’
     Base base(7, 5);
- when commenting out pureVirtual():
- pure_virtual.cpp:49:13: error: cannot declare variable ‘both’ to be of abstract type ‘Derived’
     Derived both(8, 6, 7, 5);
- *note: creating a DerivedTWO object still works since it has a defined pureVirtual() function
